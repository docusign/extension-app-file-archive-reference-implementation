# File Archive Extension App Reference Implementation
## Introduction
This reference implementation models the use case of taking an agreement PDF sent by the Docusign platform using a file archive extension app and storing it either locally or with the cloud provider of choice (AWS, Azure, or GCP).

## Authentication
This reference implementation supports two [authentication](https://developers.docusign.com/extension-apps/build-an-extension-app/it-infrastructure/authorization/) flows:
* [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/extension-apps/build-an-extension-app/it-infrastructure/authorization/#authorization-code-grant) – required for public extension apps
* [Client Credentials Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/extension-apps/build-an-extension-app/it-infrastructure/authorization/#client-credentials-grant) – available to private extension apps. See [Choosing private distribution instead of public](https://developers.docusign.com/extension-apps/extension-apps-101/choosing-private-distribution/)

*Private extension apps can use either authentication method, but public extension apps must use Authorization Code Grant.*

## Hosted Version (no setup required)
You can use the hosted version of this reference implementation by directly uploading the appropriate manifest file located in the [manifests/hosted/](manifests/hosted) folder to the Docusign Developer Console. See [Upload your manifest and create the file archive app](#3-upload-your-manifest-and-create-the-file-archive-app).

**Note:** The provided manifest includes `clientId` and `clientSecret` values used in the sample authentication connection. These do not authenticate to a real system, but the hosted reference implementation requires these exact values.

## Choose Your Setup: Local or Cloud Deployment
If you want to run the app locally using Node.js and ngrok, follow the [Local Setup Instructions](#local-setup-instructions) below.

If you want to deploy the app to the cloud using Docker and Terraform, see [Deploying an extension app to the cloud with Terraform](terraform/README.md). This includes cloud-specific setup instructions for the following cloud providers:
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)

### Video Walkthrough
[![Reference implementation videos](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_4p7GWK5aoA/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXpRTgmbu4oq4VDLJBA2BO6psxf8vkVoq&feature=shared)

### 1. Clone the repository
Run the following command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/docusign/extension-app-file-archive-reference-implementation.git
```

### 2. Generate secret values
- If you already have values for `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTHORIZATION_CODE`, you may skip this step.

The easiest way to generate a secret value is to run the following command:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'));"
```

You will need values for `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTHORIZATION_CODE`.

### 3. Set the environment variables for the cloned repository
- If you're running this in a development environment, create a copy of `example.development.env` and save it as `development.env`.
- If you're running this in a production environment, create a copy of `example.production.env` and save it as `production.env`.
- Replace `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTHORIZATION_CODE` in `development.env` or `production.env` with your generated values. These values will be used to configure the sample proxy's mock authentication server.
- Set the `clientId` value in the manifest.json file to the same value as `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`.
- Set the `clientSecret` value in the manifest.json file to the same value as `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
### 4. [Install and configure Node.js and npm on your machine.](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
### 5. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
### 6. Running the proxy server
#### Development mode:
Start the proxy server in development mode by running the command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will create a local server on the port in the `development.env` file (port 3000 by default) that listens for local changes that trigger a rebuild.

#### Production mode:
Start the proxy server in production mode by running the commands:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

This will start a production build on the port in the `production.env` file (port 3000 by default).
## Setting up ngrok
### 1. [Install and configure ngrok for your machine.](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)
### 2. Start ngrok
Run the following command to create a public accessible tunnel to your localhost:

```bash
ngrok http <PORT>
```

Replace `<PORT>` with the port number in the `development.env` or `production.env` file.

### 3. Save the forwarding address
Copy the `Forwarding` address from the response. You’ll need this address in your `manifest.json` file.

```bash
ngrok

Send your ngrok traffic logs to Datadog: https://ngrok.com/blog-post/datadog-log

Session Status                online
Account                       email@domain.com (Plan: Free)
Update                        update available (version 3.3.1, Ctrl-U to update)
Version                       3.3.0
Region                        United States (us)
Latency                       60ms
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://bbd7-12-202-171-35.ngrok-free.app -> http:

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

In this example, the `Forwarding` address to copy is `https://bbd7-12-202-171-35.ngrok-free.app`.
## Create an extension app
### 1. Prepare your app manifest
Choose a manifest from the [manifests](manifests/) folder based on the appropriate [authentication](#authentication) use case. Replace `<PROXY_BASE_URL>` in your manifest.json file with the ngrok forwarding address in the following sections:
- `connections.params.customConfig.tokenUrl`
- `connections.params.customConfig.authorizationUrl`
- `actions.params.uri`
### 2. Navigate to the [Developer Console](https://devconsole.docusign.com/apps)
Log in with your Docusign developer credentials and create a new app.
### 3. Upload your manifest and create the file archive app
To [create your extension app](https://developers.docusign.com/extension-apps/build-an-extension-app/create/), open the [Developer Console](https://devconsole.docusign.com/apps) and select **+New App.** In the app manifest editor that opens, upload your manifest file or paste into the editor itself; then select Validate. Once the editor validates your manifest, select **Create App.** 
### 4. Test the extension app
This reference implementation uses mock data to simulate how a file can be automatically archived after the signing process is completed. [Test your extension](https://developers.docusign.com/extension-apps/build-an-extension-app/test/). Extension app tests include [integration tests](https://developers.docusign.com/extension-apps/build-an-extension-app/test/integration-tests/) (connection tests and extension tests), [functional tests](https://developers.docusign.com/extension-apps/build-an-extension-app/test/functional-tests/), and [App Center preview](https://developers.docusign.com/extension-apps/build-an-extension-app/test/app-center-preview/).
